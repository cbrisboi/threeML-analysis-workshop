# Installation

To install the latest version of miniconda and create a conda environment named `fvh-threeML` with threeML, astromodels, fermipy, and HAL installed, run the script `install_everything.sh`.

If you already have conda running, you can try to run `install_from_conda.sh` instead. Make sure that the conda version you'd like to use is in your `$PATH` before running the script!
